Gone are the days when you visited a food court and  the rush made you wait for hours to enjoy your favourite snack. Imagine a platform that would enable you to order food from the point where you stand. Imagine a platform that would tell as to how much time you have to wait before the “Take Away”. The objective of this project is to provide a platform which would enable a user to enjoy food with almost zero wait time, at best price, and would delete unnecessary rush near the shops. Ever wondered ,how would it feel if one could get a chance to wave at the seller to push quick delivery.
